***Note: This webpage is no longer maintained. You can find more about me on the new website here: [https://udion.xyz/](https://udion.xyz/)***

I completed my doctoral studies at **International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems @ T&uuml;bingen, Germany [(IMPRS-IS)](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/)**,
Even earlier, I was an undergrad at **Computer Science and Engineering@[IIT-Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/)**. 

I am fascinated by interdisciplinary R&D happening at the intersection of Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Biomedical and Healthcare Informatics.
