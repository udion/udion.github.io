  title={BayesCap: Bayesian Identity Cap for Calibrated Uncertainty in Frozen Neural Networks},
  author={{Shyamgopal K.*,} {Yanbei C.,} {Massimiliano M.,} {Zeynep A.} {Uddeshya U.*}},
  abstract={
    High-quality calibrated uncertainty estimates are crucial for numerous real-world applications, especially for deep learning-based deployed ML systems. While Bayesian deep learning techniques allow uncertainty estimation, training them with large-scale datasets is an expensive process that does not always yield models competitive with non-Bayesian counterparts. Moreover, many of the high-performing deep learning models that are already trained and deployed are non-Bayesian in nature and do not provide uncertainty estimates. To address these issues, we propose BayesCap that learns a Bayesian identity mapping for the frozen model, allowing uncertainty estimation. BayesCap is a memory-efficient method that can be trained on a small fraction of the original dataset, enhancing pretrained non-Bayesian computer vision models by providing calibrated uncertainty estimates for the predictions without (i) hampering the performance of the model and (ii) the need for expensive retraining the model from scratch. The proposed method is agnostic to various architectures and tasks. We show the efficacy of our method on a wide variety of tasks with a diverse set of architectures, including image super-resolution, deblurring, inpainting, and crucial application such as medical image translation. Moreover, we apply the derived uncertainty estimates to detect out-of-distribution samples in critical scenarios like depth estimation in autonomous driving

  title={Robustness via Uncertainty-aware Cycle Consistency},
  author={{Yanbei C.,} {Zeynep A.} {Uddeshya U.}},
  abstract={
    Unpaired image-to-image translation refers to learning inter-image-domain mapping without corresponding image pairs. Existing methods learn deterministic mappings without explicitly modelling the robustness to outliers or predictive uncertainty, leading to performance degradation when encountering unseen perturbations at test time. To address this, we propose a novel probabilistic method based on Uncertainty-aware Generalized Adaptive Cycle Consistency (UGAC), which models the per-pixel residual by generalized Gaussian distribution, capable of modelling heavy-tailed distributions. We compare our model with a wide variety of state-of-the-art methods on various challenging tasks including unpaired image translation of natural images, using standard datasets, spanning autonomous driving, maps, facades, and also in medical imaging domain consisting of MRI. Experimental results demonstrate that our method exhibits stronger robustness towards unseen perturbations in test data.

  title={Uncertainty-aware GAN with Adaptive Loss for Robust MRI Image Enhancement},
  author={{Viswanath P.S.,} {Suyash P.A.} {Uddeshya U.}},
  abstract={
    Image-to-image translation is an ill-posed problem as unique one-to-one mapping may not exist between the
    source and target images. Learning-based methods proposed in this context often evaluate the performance on
    test data that is similar to the training data, which may be impractical. This demands robust methods that can quantify uncertainty in the prediction for making informed decisions, especially for critical areas such as medical imaging.
    Recent works that employ conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs) have shown improved performance in
    learning photo-realistic image-to-image mappings between the source and the target images. However, these methods do not focus on (i) robustness of the models to out-ofdistribution (OOD)-noisy data and (ii) uncertainty quantification. This paper proposes a GAN-based framework that (i) models an adaptive loss function for robustness to
    OOD-noisy data that automatically tunes the spatially varying norm for penalizing the residuals and (ii) estimates the
    per-voxel uncertainty in the predictions. We demonstrate our method on two key applications in medical imaging:
    (i) undersampled magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction (ii) MRI modality propagation. Our experiments with two different real-world datasets show that the proposed method (i) is robust to OOD-noisy test data and provides improved accuracy and (ii) quantifies voxel-level uncertainty in the predictions.

  author={{Uddeshya U.*,} {Gary F.E.,} {Zhaolin C.,} {Suyash P.A.} {Viswanath P.S.*}},
  abstract={
    Radiation exposure in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging limits its usage in the studies of radiation-sensitive populations, e.g., pregnant women, children, and adults that require longitudinal imaging. Reducing the PET radiotracer dose or acquisition time reduces photon counts, which can deteriorate image quality. Recent deep-neural-network (DNN) based methods for image-to-image translation enable the mapping of low-quality PET images (acquired using substantially reduced dose), coupled with the associated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images, to high-quality PET images. However, such DNN methods focus on applications involving test data that match the statistical characteristics of the training data very closely and give little attention to evaluating the performance of these DNNs on new out-of-distribution (OOD) acquisitions. We propose a novel DNN formulation that models the (i) underlying sinogram-based physics of the PET imaging system and (ii) the uncertainty in the DNN output through the per-voxel heteroscedasticity of the residuals between the predicted and the high-quality reference images. Our sinogram-based uncertainty-aware DNN framework, namely, suDNN, estimates a standard-dose PET image using multimodal input in the form of (i) a low-dose/low-count PET image and (ii) the corresponding multi-contrast MRI images, leading to improved robustness of suDNN to OOD acquisitions. Results on in vivo simultaneous PET-MRI, and various forms of OOD data in PET-MRI, show the benefits of suDNN over the current state of the art, quantitatively and qualitatively.

  title={Uncertainty-Guided Progressive GANs for Medical Image Translation},
  author={ {Yanbei C.,} {Tobias H.,} {Sergios G.,} {Zeynep A.} {Uddeshya U.}},
  abstract={
    Image-to-image translation plays a vital role in tackling various medical imaging tasks such as attenuation correction, motion correction, undersampled reconstruction, and denoising. Generative adversarial
    networks have been shown to achieve the state-of-the-art in generating
    high fidelity images for these tasks. However, the state-of-the-art GANbased frameworks do not estimate the uncertainty in the predictions
    made by the network that is essential for making informed medical decisions and subsequent revision by medical experts and has recently been
    shown to improve the performance and interpretability of the model. In
    this work, we propose an uncertainty-guided progressive learning scheme
    for image-to-image translation. By incorporating aleatoric uncertainty as
    attention maps for GANs trained in a progressive manner, we generate
    images of increasing fidelity progressively. We demonstrate the efficacy
    of our model on three challenging medical image translation tasks, including PET to CT translation, undersampled MRI reconstruction, and
    MRI motion artefact correction. Our model generalizes well in three different tasks and improves performance over state of the art under fullsupervision and weak-supervision with limited data. Code is released

  abstract={Medical image classification using deep learning techniques rely on highly curated datasets, which are difficult and expensive to obtain in real world due significant expertise required to annotate the dataset.

We design separate attention-driven convolution network based feature extractors for the categories. These feature learning modules are further intuitively combined so as to make the whole image recognition system end-to-end trainable.

  abstract={Deep neural networks for image quality enhancement typically need large quantities of highly-curated training data comprising pairs of low-quality images and their corresponding high-quality images. While high-quality image acquisition is typically expensive and time-consuming, medium-quality images are faster to acquire, at lower equipment costs, and available in larger quantities. Thus, we propose a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) that can leverage training data at multiple levels of quality (e.g., high and medium quality) to improve performance while limiting costs of data curation. We apply our mixed-supervision GAN to (i) super-resolve histopathology images and (ii) enhance laparoscopy images by combining super-resolution and surgical smoke removal.

  title={Spinal Stenosis Detection in MRI using Modular Coordinate Convolutional Attention Networks}, 
  year={2019},
  pages={1--8},
  abstract={Spinal stenosis is a condition in which a portion of spinal canal narrows and exerts pressure on nerves that travel through it causing pain and numbness that might require surgery. This narrowing can be caused by pathologies in bony structures (vertebrae) or soft tissue structures (intervertebral discs) that comprise the spine. Radiography, particularly Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the modality of choice to evaluate stenosis and intervertebral disc pathology. Radiologists examine axial MRI scans at various levels along the spine to detect stenosis. Further, they evaluate the diameters of spinal canal and bulging in nearby discs which can indicate narrowing and compression on nerves. Hence measuring various diameters in a scan is a crucial step in diagnosis. However, affected regions occupy a very small fraction of the scan and there is virtually no room for error as a deviation of few pixels will also lead to discrepancies in measured and original lengths which makes it a very difficult and laborious task to measure the length of such intricate structures accurately. We propose a novel deep learning based solution to tackle this problem. Our method attempts to solve it in two independent modules and allows us to make prediction on the enlarged section of the scan which also makes it easier to measure various lengths. Human radiologists focus on certain parts of the scan rather than attending to the entire scan which largely consists of irrelevant background. We design our modular approach to mimic this attention mechanism. Both of our modules are built using coordinate convolutional networks, we also perform the comparison with baseline and empirically demonstrate superiority of our approach.},

We propose a loss based on an autoencoder-based manifold-distance between the super-resolved and high-resolution images, to reproduce realistic textural content in super-resolved images. We propose to learn to super-resolve images to match human perceptions of structure, luminance, and contrast.

  title={Removal of Batch Effects using GANs}, 
  year={2019},
  abstract={Many biological data analysis processes like Cytometry or Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) produce massive amounts of data which needs to be processed in batches for down-stream analysis. Such datasets are prone to technical variations due to difference in handling the batches possibly at different times, by different experimenters or under other different conditions. This adds variation to the batches coming from the same source sample. These variations are known as Batch Effects. It is possible that these variations and natural variations due to biology confound but such situations can be avoided by performing experiments in a carefully planned manner. Batch effects can hamper downstream analysis and may also cause results to be inconclusive. Thus, it is essential to correct for these effects. This can be solved using a novel Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) based framework that is proposed here, advantage of using this framework over other prior approaches is that here it is not required to choose a reproducing kernel and define its parameters. Results of the framework on a mass cytometry dataset are reported.},

A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
