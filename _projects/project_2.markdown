Simulations for Spiking Neural Networks. This supports Feed forward SNNs using Leaky Integrate and Fire Neurons and Dynamic Random Networks. Basic components such as neurons (Hodgkin-Huxley, Adaptive Integrate and Fire, Leaky Integrate and Fire, Izhikevich) along with various synapses (different kinds of STDPs) are also supported.
