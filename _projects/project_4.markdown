The zypher package is developed to provide side channel analysis tool to people working in the areas such as cryptography. The structure is designed in an intuitive manner which may be extended and customised to meet oneâ€™s own cipher apart from some pre loaded ciphers such as AES-128. One can also extend the package by including files (or function) of thier own versions of attacks apart from what is provided such as Correlation Power Analysis (CPA), Template Attacks (TA).
